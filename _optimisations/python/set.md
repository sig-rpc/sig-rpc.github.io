Similar to the mathematical concept of a set, Python (and most other languages) provides a data structure `Set` which is a collection of unique values without a specific order. Using a `set()` is the fastest way to detect unique items (e.g. `if a in my_set`) or remove duplicates (`[x for x in set(my_list)]`).
