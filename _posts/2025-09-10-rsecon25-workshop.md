On the 10th September we're hosting our first workshop at [RSECon25](https://rsecon25.society-rse.org/) (15:30-17:00 in OC0.04).


[This workshop](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/event/75166/submission/12) will invite attendees to contribute to our knowledge-base, whether that's contributing to [optimisation](/optimisations) or [profiler](/profilers) mini-guides, or reviewing the existing ones.

## Pre-requisites

This workshop is appropriate for attendees that know any programming language used by researchers (e.g. Python, R, C/C++, etc), regardless of their expertise. The exercises available will suit attendees from novice (e.g. reviewing the accessibility of existing materials) to expert (e.g. proposing or drafting new guidance) .

## Preparation

This workshop doesn't require any advanced tooling, everything can be completed with your favourite web browser and text editor (and a GitHub account). We'll bring along some paper forms too, for anyone who fancies a break from their laptop.

You may however want to reflect on what you can contribute ahead of the workshop. Take a look at the [existing optimisations](/optimisations), are these applicable to the language you use? Or are there similar performance patterns you've come across in your own work?

If you have some code you could profile during the workshop, bring that along, you can contribute a profiler mini-guide instead, and maybe profiling your own code will highlight a new performance pattern.

Don't worry if you haven't got time to prepare ahead of the workshop, we'll be bringing along a small backlog of known optimisations that we're yet to document, or you can help test and review existing content.

## guidance

*We'll add this detailed guidance for the workshop closer to the event (likely morning of).*

See you there!
