Intel VTune Profiler is a fully-featured profiler that supports a broad range of languages. Users wishing to perform function or line level profiling can use the default "Hotspots" configuration, that will output profiling results in an interactive GUI with several visualisations to aide interpretation. There are also many more advanced profiling configurations available, covering memory and hardware metrics, these are unlikely to be useful for the typical programmer.
