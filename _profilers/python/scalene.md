Scalene is a modern Python profiler that supports a wide range of profiling styles. It provides both a command line interface and a web-based GUI for visualising results. Unlike many other Python profilers it uses a sampling approach to minimise the profiling overhead, making it suitable for profiling expensive use-cases. It also allows users, with an OpenAI API key, to receive AI powered optimisation suggestions.
